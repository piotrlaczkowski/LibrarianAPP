# 📊 Stock Research Agent — Version 3


* [Version 2](./deep-research-agents-v2)
* [Version 3](./deep-research-agents-v3)


## 🚀 Overview

This is the **third version (V3)** of the Stock Research Agent, built on top of the LangGraph + LangSmith ecosystem.  
Version 3 brings a production-grade architecture with a modular backend and an interactive frontend powered by **Deep Agents UI**.

It extends Version 2 by introducing real-time observability, agent collaboration, and a complete local deployment workflow.

## 📊 Version Comparison (V1 vs V2 vs V3)

| Feature | Version 1 (Old) | Version 2 (Improved) | **Version 3 (New)** |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Configuration** | Hardcoded in `.py` | `.env`, `.json`, `.md` external configs | Same as V2 |
| **Search Provider** | Fixed to Brave | Optional Brave / Tavily (auto-selected) | Same as V2 |
| **Sub-agents** | Defined inline in code | Externalized in `subagents.json` | Same as V2 |
| **Core Instructions** | Inline (long) | Moved to `instructions.md` | Same as V2 |
| **Token Usage per Query** | ~13 000 | ~3 500 | Same as V2 |
| **Response Time** | Slow (bloated context) | 60–70 % faster (context engineered) | Same as V2 |
| **UI** | Basic textbox | Markdown + Chat UI (Gradio) | **Integrated with Deep Agents UI via LangSmith Server** |
| **Error Handling** | Minimal | Graceful fallbacks, provider status banners | Same as V2 |
| **Backend Runtime** | Local Python | Gradio app | **LangGraph / LangSmith Server** |
| **Deployment** | Manual | Scripted | Same as V2 + UI integration |
| **Monitoring** | None | Console logs | **UI-based interaction through Deep Agents UI** |

## 📉 Token Usage Optimization

* **Before (v1):** \~13,000 tokens per research query (bloated instructions + redundant context).
* **Now (v2):** \~3,500 tokens per query.
* Achieved through:

  * Externalizing prompts (`.md` + `.json` files).
  * Removing redundant instructions.
  * Adding clear tool descriptions.
  * Context-aware selective tool usage.

💰 **Impact:** Reducing from 13k → 3.5k tokens saves \~73% in API costs and improves response latency by 60–70%.

## 📚 New Learnings & Best Practices

### 🔄 Handling Recursion Limits

* When deep agents or tools recurse too much, Python may throw a `RecursionError`.
* **Avoid simply increasing the recursion limit** — it may hide design flaws or cause infinite loops.
* Instead:

  * Set clear stopping conditions in agents.
  * Limit maximum depth of reasoning/tool calls.
  * Use guardrails in prompts to discourage looping.

### 📝 Prompt & Tool Definition Practices

* Keep prompts **precise** and **minimal**.
* Avoid duplicate phrases across instructions and sub-agent definitions (they bloat token count).
* Provide **short, structured tool descriptions** instead of verbose text.
* Define workflows clearly so the model doesn’t need extra clarification cycles.

#### Example 1: Context Engineering for Tool Descriptions

**Before (v1, verbose):**

```python
@tool
def get_stock_price(symbol: str) -> str:
    """This tool is designed to fetch stock-related data, including price, company name, market capitalization, P/E ratio, and 52-week highs and lows. Use this whenever you need to know about a company's stock."""
```

**After (v2, concise):**

```python
@tool
def get_stock_price(symbol: str) -> str:
    """Fetch stock price, company name, market cap, P/E ratio, 52-week range."""
```

➡️ The shorter description conveys the same meaning but reduces tokens and avoids repetition.

**Token Comparison:**

* v1: \~60 tokens
* v2: \~20 tokens
* **Reduction:** \~67%

#### Example 2: Context Engineering for Sub-Agent Prompts

**Before (v1, verbose):**

```python
fundamental_analyst = {
    "name": "fundamental-analyst",
    "description": "Performs deep fundamental analysis of companies including financial ratios, growth metrics, and valuation",
    "prompt": """You are an expert fundamental analyst with 15+ years of experience. 
    Focus on:
    - Financial statement analysis
    - Ratio analysis (P/E, P/B, ROE, ROA, Debt-to-Equity)
    - Growth metrics and trends
    - Industry comparisons
    - Intrinsic value calculations
    Always provide specific numbers and cite your sources.""",
}
```

**After (v2, concise):**

```python
fundamental_analyst = {
    "name": "fundamental-analyst",
    "description": "Performs company fundamental analysis",
    "prompt": "You are a fundamental analyst. Focus only on:\n- Financial statements (Revenue, Net Income, Assets, Debt)\n- Ratios: P/E, P/B, ROE, ROA, Debt/Equity\n- Growth trends vs peers\n- Valuation (intrinsic value)"
}
```

➡️ Context was streamlined by removing persona fluff ("expert with 15+ years") and redundant phrasing. The new version conveys the same scope but with fewer tokens.

**Token Comparison:**

* v1: \~120 tokens
* v2: \~55 tokens
* **Reduction:** \~55%

### Why Tool Descriptions Matter

* Tool descriptions are always loaded into the agent’s context.
* Long, verbose descriptions add up quickly because they are **repeated on every query**.
* Short, clear descriptions save tokens while still giving the model enough guidance.
* Example: If you have 5 tools and each has a 100-token description, that’s **500 tokens added to every query** — even if only 1 tool is used.

### ⚡ Controlling Context for Speed

* Externalize large prompts and configs into `.md` and `.json` files.
* Pass only the **needed tools** and **subagents** for each run.
* Remove unnecessary background text or repetition.
* Result: faster responses, fewer tokens, and no information loss.

---

## ✅ Quick Checklist

* [ ] Keep tool descriptions under 1–2 lines.
* [ ] Avoid persona fluff in sub-agent prompts.
* [ ] Externalize long instructions to `.md` and `.json` files.
* [ ] Monitor token counts with `tiktoken` or similar utilities.
* [ ] Set guardrails to prevent recursion loops.

---

## 🔮 Next Steps

* Add multi-company comparative analysis.
* Add streaming responses for real-time progress display.
* Extend UI with charts (price trends, RSI graphs).
* Option to export reports as PDF.

---

## ✅ Summary

Version 2 of the Stock Research Agent delivers:

* Cleaner configuration (`.env`, `.json`, `.md`).
* Flexible and optional search provider setup.
* Optimized token usage with **context engineering**.
* Practical learnings on recursion, prompt design, and context control.
* Much faster and cheaper queries without sacrificing depth.

This sets the foundation for more advanced reporting, visualization, and deployment.
