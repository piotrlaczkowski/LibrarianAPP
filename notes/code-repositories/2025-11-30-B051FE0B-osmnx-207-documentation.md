# OSMnx 2.0.7 documentation

## Summary

OSMnx is a Python package that downloads any city’s street network, buildings, bike lanes, rail, or walkable paths from OpenStreetMap and instantly turns them into clean, routable NetworkX graphs with correct topology, projected coordinates, edge lengths, bearings, and travel speeds. 

It integrates seamlessly with GeoPandas, Matplotlib, and PyTorch Geometric/DGL, making it the standard tool for urban morphology analysis, accessibility modeling, traffic simulation, walkability studies, and training Graph Neural Networks on real-world cities. The backbone of almost every serious urban data science project today.

You can download and model walking, driving, or biking networks with a single line of code then analyze and visualize them. You can just as easily work with urban amenities/points of interest, building footprints, transit stops, elevation data, street orientations, speed/travel time, and routing. OSMnx 2.0 is released: read the migration guide . Citation ¶ If you use OSMnx in your work, please cite the paper: Boeing, G. (2025). Modeling and Analyzing Urban Networks and Amenities with OSMnx . Geographical Analysis 57 (4), 567-577. doi:10.1111/gean.70009 Getting Started ¶ First read the Getting Started guide for an introduction to the package and FAQ. Then work through the Examples Gallery for step-by-step tutorials and sample code. Installation ¶ Follow the Installation guide to install OSMnx. If you have any trouble, consult the User Reference .
