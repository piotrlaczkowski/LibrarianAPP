# Not ready for the bench: LLM legal interpretation is unstable and out of step with human judgments

## Summary

This paper shows LLM legal interpretations are unstable and often unlike what ordinary people think.

Shows LLMs can look confident while missing how non-experts read legal language.

The authors test many models on insurance scenarios using simple yes or no questions.

Small changes in phrasing flip both answers and probabilities, so any single prompt is unreliable.

6 of 15 models repeated one side in about 92% of cases, which looks like a stopped clock.

The best setup matched human majorities only 83% of the time.

Direct LLM queries should not be used as a proxy for ordinary meaning in legal disputes.

Recent scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models (LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the conclusions produced by generative AI.
