We support this 25 european languages: Bulgarian (bg), Croatian (hr), Czech (cs), Danish (da), Dutch (nl), English (en), Estonian (et), Finnish (fi), French (fr), German (de), Greek (el), Hungarian (hu), Italian (it), Latvian (lv), Lithuanian (lt), Maltese (mt), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), Romanian (ro), Slovak (sk), Slovenian (sl), Spanish (es), Swedish (sv), Russian (ru), Ukrainian (uk) What is the recommended hardware for Murmure ? Murmure is designed to be lightweight and efficient, so it can run on most devices with CPU-only desktop. However, we recommend a device with at least 2GB of RAM available and 1GB of disk space. No GPU Needed What is your business model ? No business model, no ads, no tracking, no data collection, no compromise. We were tired of paid speech-to-text tools that sacrifice privacy for convenience so we built one that doesn&#x27;t. Our only reward is to be used by people who care about their privacy. Why did you use Parakeet and not Whisper ? We use Parakeet because it is a more accurate speech-to-text model and it is more optimized for low-end devices. Parakeet is as accurate than whsiper-large model (1.5B parameters) but with only 0.6B parameters making him incredibly efficient for offline and performance usage.
