Unlike prior e-commerce benchmarks, ShoppingComp introduces highly complex tasks under the principle of guaranteeing real products and ensuring easy verifiability, adding a novel evaluation dimension for identifying product safety hazards alongside recommendation accuracy and report quality. The benchmark comprises 120 tasks and 1,026 scenarios, curated by 35 experts to reflect authentic shopping needs. Results reveal stark limitations of current LLMs: even state-of-the-art models achieve low performance (e.g., 11.22% for GPT-5, 3.92% for Gemini-2.5-Flash). These findings highlight a substantial gap between research benchmarks and real-world deployment, where LLMs make critical errors such as failure to identify unsafe product usage or falling for promotional misinformation, leading to harmful recommendations. ShoppingComp fills the gap and thus establishes a new standard for advancing reliable and practical agents in e-commerce.
